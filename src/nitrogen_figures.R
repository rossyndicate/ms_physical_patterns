# Nitrogen data viz script

#### README ####
# The following script will create sequential
# figures for use in Heili's 2024 AGU talk to
# discuss MacroSheds as a project as well as
# annual & monthly nitrogen trends.

# It will also create figures for Heili's poster
# at the 2025 Gordon Research Conference and,
# ultimately, the N manuscript.
